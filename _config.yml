description: > 
  We're on a mission to enable users to easily filter their images for the content they are looking for. We have an AI system that automatically analyzes the content and style of an image. It tells you keywords that describe the image and how good it is compared to professional shots. Don't waste your time filtering and sorting your images when you can do it with our SDK automatically.
